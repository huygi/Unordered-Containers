  /// Implement ExtendedBook's constructor.  Avoid setting the base class's attributes within the body of this function.  Instead,
  /// be sure to use a Constructor Member Initialization List to construct the base class passing the proper values. Look up member
  /// initialization if you don't remember what that is.  See

  ///
    /// This function constructs an extended book by first constructing the base class and then populating a word frequency table as
    /// the book's content is read.  In the function's body:
    ///   i  Open the disk file containing this book's content as an input file stream.  The name of the disk file, if it exists, is
    ///      ISBN.bok where ISBN is the book's 10 or 13 digit ISBN.  For example, 9789999275842.bok contains the text of book with
    ///      an ISBN of "9789999275842" titled "Billboard Music Week (1st edition)" by "Joel Whitburn".
    ///  ii. Read from the input stream a single word at a time (delimited by whitespace as defined in standard C++) until end of
    ///      file, and for each word read
    /// iii. increment the number of times this (sanitized) word has appeared in the text if it has been seen before, otherwise add
    ///      it to the table and initialize the frequency.
    ///
    /// Constraint: Only "sanitized" words should be added to the frequency table. For example, leading and trailing punctuation,
    /// parentheses, brackets, etc. should be removed, but intra - word punctuation should remain. A working sanitize function has
    /// been provided.
